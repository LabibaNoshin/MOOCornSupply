An Application of Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques in Green Supply Chain Network Design

##
One of the major concerns of green supply chain management is to balance costs and carbon dioxide CO2 emissions throughout the entire supply chain network. This study proposes a multi-objective model that minimizes total cost and CO2 emissions simultaneously. The problem is demonstrated by considering the supply network between crop production zones and plants that necessitate the specific crop. Additionally, a heuristic approach is also introduced to assess the  solutions. The study employs weighted sum method to determine the optimal and heuristic solutions. The results indicate a proximity between heuristic and optimal solutions for small-scale problems. The result also demonstrates that for a larger problem scenario where identifying the optimal solution is challenging, the proposed approach successfully achieves a heuristic solution.
